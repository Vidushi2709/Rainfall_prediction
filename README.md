# Rainfall Classification Project

## Overview
This project implements a binary classification system to predict rainfall occurrence ("will it rain or not"). Multiple machine learning models were evaluated to determine the optimal approach for precipitation prediction.

## Model Performance
The following classification models were trained and evaluated, with their respective accuracy scores:

| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|----------|
| Random Forest Classifier | 0.8750 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.8708 |
| CatBoost | 0.8701 |
| XGBoost | 0.8630 |
| Stacking Ensemble (RFC+XGBoost+LogReg) | 0.8561 |
| LSTM | 0.8447 |

Based on these results, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the highest prediction accuracy at 87.50%.

## Requirements
The project requires the following major dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM)
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of numerical features, encoding of categorical variables, and handling of missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant meteorological features from raw weather data.
3. **Model Training**: Implementation and tuning of multiple classification algorithms.
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Exploration of stacking ensemble techniques combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
5. **Evaluation**: Model assessment using accuracy metrics and cross-validation.

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy (87.50%), suggesting it is the most suitable model for this rainfall prediction task. While the stacking ensemble approach was explored, it did not improve upon the individual model performance, indicating that the complexity of the ensemble may not be justified for this particular dataset.

## Future Work
- Implementation of more sophisticated feature engineering techniques
- Exploration of additional meteorological data sources
- Deployment of the model as a web service for real-time prediction
- Investigation of imbalanced learning techniques if class distribution is skewed
